## Overview

The **Company Founder Retrieval** script is designed to fetch information about company founders based on the company names provided in a .csv file. The script utilizes the Crunchbase API and web scraping techniques, with considerations for handling errors, managing multiple requests, and ensuring accuracy and scalability.

## Features

- Retrieves founder information for companies listed in a .csv file.
- Uses Crunchbase API for data retrieval.
- Implements web scraping for additional data.
- Handles errors gracefully and manages multiple requests.
- Scalable and accurate.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `pandas`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/company-founder-retrieval.git
   cd company-founder-retrieval
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:

   Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas requests bs4 csv urllib

3. **Set up environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your Crunchbase API key:

   ```env

   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your .csv file**:

   Ensure your .csv file is in the format:

   ```

   The script will process the `input.csv` file, fetch the founder information, and output the results in `output.csv`.
